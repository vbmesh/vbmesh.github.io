<h2>Welcome to VBMesh.net</h2>
<p>
  Want to show up on the Mesh Map? Follow these steps to set up your node:
  <br><br>
  <h3>Channels: </h3>
  Select "Uplink enabled" in your primary channel to share info about other nodes seen, given that they have "okay to mqtt" enabled.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Device:</h3>
  - Role: select "client" or "client mute" 
  <h3>Lora Settings: </h3>
  - Number of Hops: set this to 3 or 4. 4-5 hops can be okay if you are using a client_mute role.
  - "OK to MQTT" turned on: this allows the packets sent from your node to be relayed to other nodes with mqtt, and if you want to show up on the map.
  <br><br>
