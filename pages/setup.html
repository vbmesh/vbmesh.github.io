<h2>Welcome to VBMesh.net</h2>
<p>
  Want to show up on the Mesh Map? Follow these steps to set up your node:
  <br><br>
  <h3>Channels: </h3>
  Select "Uplink enabled" in your primary channel (for most, this is probably LongFast)to share info about other nodes seen, given that they have "okay to mqtt" enabled.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Device:</h3>
  - Role: select "client" or "client_mute"
  <br><br>
  <h3>Location:</h3>
  - Tip: if your node doesn't have a GPS module or is fixed (not mobile or handheld), turn on "fixed position", and enter the node's latitude and longitude.
  <br><br>
  <h3>Lora Settings: </h3>
  - Modem Preset: LongFast <br><br>
  - Region: US915 <br><br>
  - Hop Limit: set this to 3 or 4. 4-5 hops can be okay if you are using a client_mute role.
  - <b>"OK to MQTT" turned on: this allows the packets sent from your node to be relayed to other nodes with mqtt, and if you want to show up on the map.</b>
  <br><br>
